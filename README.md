# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis if to explore PyBer ride data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fares based on the type of city which PyBer operates. In the analysis, we sort the data by city type; Urban, Suburban, and Rural, and create visualizations to better understand the data so PyBer executives can make better operating decisions.
## Results
After aggregating the data, the summary of each city type illustrates the differences in ridership and fare:

- Urban Cities have the highest ridership demand at 1,625 rides, while Rural Cities have the lowest demand at 125 rides
- Urban Cities have almost 5x the drivers as Suburban Cities and over 30 times the drivers as Rural Cities
- Urban Cities generate the most revenue at $39,854.38, over 2x the revenue of the second highest city type Suburban
- Rural cities produce the least rides and the highest average fare per Driver, while Urban cities produce the most rides with the lowest average fare per Driver demonstrating a positive relationship between ride totals and average fare per Driver.

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis, my recommendations to PyBer are as follow: Additional time analysis is needed. Based on the average fare per ride data, it would suggest that riders in Rural areas are taking significantly longer trips than riders in Urban areas, so gaining a better understanding of trip distances would help. Having a better understanding of the differences in trip length means you can better budget drivers time and amount of drivers needed. There are also 50% more drivers in Urban areas than there are rides, whereas in Suburabn and Rural areas there is the opposite more rides than drivers. By looking at the time data, we understand there are times where drivers can be pulled from different city types to better meet demand in other city types. One example would be removing drivers from Suburban cities and moving them to Urban cities in early March to meet a peak in demand. Analysis can go further in the number of fares per driver as well. Despite the average fare per driver being higher in Rural areas, drivers in Urban areas may be able to produce more rides and revenue per shitft or hour due to the increased demand and shorter trip distances. It would be beneficial to better understand productivity of drivers because the strategy of companies like PyBer in the ridesharing business is a low cost strategy so higher driver productivity means higher revenues and higher profits.
